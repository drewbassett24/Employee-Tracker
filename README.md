This command-line application allows the user to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

  * Update employee managers

  * View employees by manager

  * Delete departments, roles, and employees

  * View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department

Use this application to search, list and edit employees in a company, by role, manager or department.
To use the app, you need to download Node and the Inquirer and MySQL dependancies.
Then use Node index.js to run it.
